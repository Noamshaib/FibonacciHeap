# FibonacciHeap
Fibonacci Heap - This project contains a class that implements a Fibonacci Heap. This implementation includes methods for inserting elements into the heap, extracting the minimum element, and performing a union operation on two heaps. All of the methods are done in O(1) time complexity (amortized).
